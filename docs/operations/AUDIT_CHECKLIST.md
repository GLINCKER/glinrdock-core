## Security Audit Steps

### Static Analysis
```bash
make audit          # Run all quality checks
make vuln           # Check for known vulnerabilities  
golangci-lint run   # Comprehensive linting
```

### Runtime Analysis  
```bash
# Check for race conditions
go test -race ./...

# Profile memory usage
go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap

# Check for goroutine leaks
go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/goroutine
```

### Manual Review Areas
- Token handling and comparison logic
- Input validation for container configurations  
- SQL query construction
- File path handling and directory traversal prevention
- Docker socket access patterns
- Service links validation and RBAC enforcement
- Network information exposure in API responses
- Service alias generation security implications
