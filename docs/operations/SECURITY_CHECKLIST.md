# GLINRDOCK Security Checklist

This checklist provides security guidelines for deploying and operating GLINRDOCK with encrypted secrets-at-rest.

## Pre-Deployment Security

### ✅ Environment Variables & Configuration

- [ ] **GLINRDOCK_SECRET** is set with a cryptographically secure 32-byte key

- [ ] Master encryption key is stored in a secure secrets management system (not in code/config files)
- [ ] Environment variables are not logged in application logs
- [ ] Configuration files exclude sensitive data
- [ ] `.env` files are excluded from version control

### ✅ Key Management

- [ ] Master encryption key has been backed up securely
- [ ] Key backup is stored separately from the main deployment
- [ ] Key rotation procedure is documented and tested
- [ ] Multiple authorized personnel can access the backup key
- [ ] Key access is logged and monitored
- [ ] Development/staging environments use different keys than production

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Default admin token has been changed from `admin-token`
- [ ] API tokens follow the principle of least privilege
- [ ] Viewer roles cannot access decrypted secrets
- [ ] Token permissions are regularly audited
- [ ] Expired or unused tokens are removed
- [ ] Token generation uses cryptographically secure random generation

### ✅ GitHub Integrations Security

- [ ] GitHub OAuth client secrets are properly encrypted at rest
- [ ] GitHub App private keys are stored encrypted (never in plaintext)
- [ ] Integration settings are only accessible by admin users
- [ ] OAuth mode configuration follows security best practices:
  - [ ] PKCE mode used for client-side applications
  - [ ] Confidential mode used only when client secret can be secured
- [ ] GitHub App private key format is validated (RSA PEM)
- [ ] Integration configuration changes are audit logged
- [ ] GitHub webhook signatures are validated (when implemented)
- [ ] OAuth callback URLs are properly restricted
- [ ] GitHub App permissions follow principle of least privilege

## Runtime Security

### ✅ Network Security

- [ ] GLINRDOCK API is served over HTTPS in production

### ✅ Database Security

- [ ] Database files have restricted file permissions (600)
- [ ] Database is stored on encrypted storage
- [ ] Database backups are encrypted
- [ ] Database connection is secured (if using remote database)
- [ ] Regular database integrity checks are performed
- [ ] Database logs are monitored for suspicious activity

### ✅ Container Security

- [ ] GLINRDOCK container runs as non-root user
- [ ] Container image is regularly updated
- [ ] Host system is hardened and updated
- [ ] Resource limits are configured
- [ ] Security scanning is performed on container images

- [ ] Logs are stored securely and access is controlled

### ✅ Backup & Recovery

- [ ] Regular automated backups are configured
- [ ] Backups include both database and encryption keys
- [ ] Backup integrity is regularly tested
- [ ] Recovery procedures are documented and tested
- [ ] Backups are encrypted and stored securely
- [ ] Backup access is logged and audited

### ✅ Access Control

- [ ] User accounts follow the principle of least privilege
- [ ] Regular access reviews are conducted
- [ ] Inactive accounts are disabled/removed
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication is implemented where possible
- [ ] Service accounts have appropriate restrictions
- [ ] API access is monitored and rate-limited

## Incident Response

### ✅ Preparation

- [ ] Incident response plan includes encryption key compromise scenarios
- [ ] Emergency contacts are documented and current
- [ ] Key rotation procedures are documented
- [ ] Data breach notification procedures are established
- [ ] Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) are defined

### ✅ Detection

- [ ] Monitoring systems can detect:
  - [ ] Unusual encryption/decryption patterns
  - [ ] Failed authentication attempts
  - [ ] Unauthorized data access
  - [ ] Configuration changes
  - [ ] System compromise indicators

### ✅ Response

- [ ] Procedures for key rotation in case of compromise
- [ ] Steps for revoking compromised tokens
- [ ] Process for isolating affected systems
- [ ] Communication plan for stakeholders

## Compliance & Auditing

### ✅ Data Protection

- [ ] Data classification policy covers encrypted secrets
- [ ] Data retention policies are implemented
- [ ] Data destruction procedures are secure
- [ ] Cross-border data transfer requirements are met
- [ ] Encryption standards meet regulatory requirements

### ✅ Audit Trail

- [ ] All secret access is logged with:
  - [ ] User identity
  - [ ] Timestamp
  - [ ] Service/secret accessed
  - [ ] Operation performed
  - [ ] Source IP address
- [ ] Integration settings access is audit logged:
  - [ ] Configuration reads (sampled 1:10 to reduce volume)
  - [ ] All configuration updates with detailed change metadata
  - [ ] GitHub App installation URL generation
  - [ ] Failed validation attempts with error details
- [ ] Audit logs are tamper-proof
