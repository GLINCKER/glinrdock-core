## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Plan

### API Client Architecture
```typescript
// Centralized API client
class APIClient {
  private baseURL: string
  private token: string | null
  
  // HTTP methods with auth
  async get<T>(endpoint: string): Promise<T>
  async post<T>(endpoint: string, data: any): Promise<T>
  async delete<T>(endpoint: string): Promise<T>
  
  // Auth management
  setToken(token: string): void
  clearToken(): void
  isAuthenticated(): boolean
}
```

### State Management Approach
- **Simple useState hooks** for component-level state
- **Custom hooks** for API data fetching (`useProjects`, `useServices`)
- **Context API** only for auth state
- **Local storage** for token persistence

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Toast notifications** for user-facing errors
- **Loading states** for all async operations  
- **Retry logic** for network failures
- **Graceful degradation** when APIs are unavailable

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading** for non-critical components
- **Debounced API calls** for search/filter
- **Caching** for frequently accessed data
- **Minimal re-renders** with proper dependency arrays

## üìä API Endpoints to Integrate

### Authentication & Health
- `GET /v1/health` - System health check
- `GET /v1/system` - System info and metrics

### Project Management  
- `GET /v1/projects` - List projects
- `POST /v1/projects` - Create project
- `GET /v1/projects/:id` - Project details
- `DELETE /v1/projects/:id` - Delete project

### Service Management
- `GET /v1/projects/:id/services` - Services in project
- `POST /v1/projects/:id/services` - Create service
- `GET /v1/services/:id` - Service details
- `POST /v1/services/:id/start` - Start service
- `POST /v1/services/:id/stop` - Stop service
- `GET /v1/services/:id/logs` - Service logs

### Route Management
- `GET /v1/routes` - List all routes
- `GET /v1/projects/:id/routes` - Routes for project
- `POST /v1/projects/:id/routes` - Create route

### System & Metrics
- `GET /v1/metrics` - System metrics
- `GET /v1/services/:id/stats` - Service statistics

## üö¶ Implementation Priorities

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Must Have)
1. API client with authentication
2. Real dashboard stats (projects, services, routes counts)
3. System health indicators
4. Basic project CRUD operations
5. Service status display and start/stop

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Should Have)
1. Service logs viewer (last 50 lines)
2. Route management interface
3. Node status display
4. Enhanced error handling with toasts

### **LOW PRIORITY** (Nice to Have)
1. Real-time updates via polling
2. Advanced service metrics
3. Bulk operations
4. Export/import functionality

## üìè Bundle Size Targets
- **JavaScript**: < 35KB gzipped (currently ~9KB)
- **CSS**: < 20KB gzipped (currently ~4KB)
- **Total bundle**: < 55KB gzipped
- **First Load**: < 2 seconds on slow 3G

## üîÑ Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branch**: Create branch for each major feature
2. **API First**: Implement API client methods
3. **UI Integration**: Connect UI components to APIs
4. **Testing**: Manual testing with backend
5. **Bundle Check**: Verify size limits after each feature
6. **Documentation**: Update this checklist as completed

## üìù Notes for Heavy NextJS App
- Track API patterns that work well
- Document performance bottlenecks
- Note missing features needed for full app
- Collect user feedback on essential vs nice-to-have features
- Architecture decisions that scale vs need refactoring
