# Settings Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the completed architecture and implementation of the GLINR Dock Settings system, which provides centralized configuration management for authentication, system administration, integrations, and platform settings.

## Completed Architecture

### Main Settings Hub (`/settings`)

The settings hub provides a unified interface with professional card-based navigation:

- Centralized navigation to all settings categories
- Status indicators showing configuration state
- Consistent design patterns across all components
- Professional glassmorphism design with light/dark mode support

### Settings Pages Structure

#### Authentication Page (`/settings/auth`)

**Purpose**: User authentication and access control management

**Features**:
- Complete API Token Management (create, list, delete tokens with role assignment)
- GitHub OAuth Integration for user authentication (client ID/secret configuration)
- Enhanced Session Management (detailed session info, secure sign-out)
- Security features (password toggles, role-based indicators, security warnings)
- Professional UI with proper error handling and loading states

**Backend Integration**:
- Token management via `/v1/tokens` endpoints
- OAuth configuration via `/v1/settings/integrations` endpoints
- Session management via `/v1/auth/me` and logout endpoints

#### Plan & Licensing Page (`/settings/plan-limits`)

**Purpose**: Subscription and resource management

**Features**:
- Current plan status and resource limits display
- License management (activation, deactivation)
- Usage monitoring and quota tracking
- Professional card design with status indicators

#### Certificates Page (`/settings/certificates`)

**Purpose**: DNS and SSL certificate management

**Features**:
- DNS provider configuration (Cloudflare, Route53, manual)
- SSL certificate management and automation
- Domain verification and certificate issuance
- Integration with DNS providers for automated validation

#### Environment Templates Page (`/settings/environment-templates`)

**Purpose**: Reusable environment variable template management

**Current State**: Basic page structure with backend API integration pending

## Authentication vs Integrations Distinction

### Authentication Page (`/settings/auth`)
- **GitHub OAuth Configuration**: For USER authentication and login
- **API Token Management**: For programmatic access control
- **Session Management**: Current user session security

### Integrations Page (`/settings/integrations`)
- **GitHub App Integration**: For REPOSITORY automation and CI-CD
- **Webhook Management**: For deployment automation
- **DNS & Certificates**: Domain management integrations
- **Nginx Proxy**: Reverse proxy configuration

This separation serves different purposes:
- OAuth handles "How do users log in?"
- GitHub App handles "How does the platform integrate with repositories?"

## Design System

### Consistent Styling
- All cards use `bg-white dark:glassmorphism` for proper light/dark compatibility
- Professional borders with `border border-gray-200 dark:border-white/10`
- Consistent shadow system with hover effects
- Gradient backgrounds for icons and accent elements

### Navigation Patterns
- Breadcrumb navigation on all pages
- Consistent header styling with gradient text
- Professional button system with hover animations
- Responsive design working on desktop and mobile

### Status Indicators
- Color-coded status badges (green for active, gray for inactive, red for errors)
- Visual authentication method indicators
- Progress indicators for licensing and quotas
- Security alert styling for different authentication modes

## Backend API Integration

### Authentication APIs
- `/v1/tokens` - Complete token management (GET, POST, DELETE)
- `/v1/auth/me` - Current user authentication info
- `/v1/settings/integrations` - OAuth configuration management

### System APIs
- `/v1/system/status` - System health and uptime
- `/v1/system/metrics` - Resource usage and performance
- `/v1/system/license` - License management
- `/v1/system/backup` and `/v1/system/restore` - Backup operations

### Certificate APIs
- DNS provider management endpoints
- Certificate issuance and renewal automation
- Domain verification workflows

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1-5: Foundation (Completed)
- Fixed build errors and navigation issues
- Unified architecture with consistent design patterns  
- Fixed routing conflicts and URL handling
- Implemented professional UI consistency
- Enhanced core content implementation

### Phase 10: Settings Hub Enhancement (Completed)
- Professional card-based navigation
- Status indicators for all major categories
- Hover animations and proper styling
- Comprehensive settings organization

### Phase 11: Search Integration (Completed)
- Updated command palette with consolidated structure
- Removed obsolete search entries
- Added comprehensive keywords for new pages
- Integrated help system with new structure

### Phase 12: Design Consistency (Completed)
- Applied professional design pattern across all cards
- Fixed light/dark mode compatibility
- Enhanced hover effects and transitions
- Removed duplicate sections and cleaned up layout

### Phase 13: Authentication Enhancement (Completed)
- Complete OAuth integration UI
- Enhanced session management
- Professional security indicators
- Backend API integration for settings management

## Success Criteria Met
