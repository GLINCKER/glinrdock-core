  Summary of what was accomplished:

  1. ✅ Resolved the "Access Restricted" Error: The issue was that the isAdminSync() function was being
  called before the auth info was loaded asynchronously. I fixed this by:
    - Changing from isAdminSync() to using getAuthInfo() asynchronously
    - Adding proper loading states for auth info
    - Ensuring the component waits for auth info before rendering
  2. ✅ Created a Dedicated Registries Page:
    - Moved the registry management functionality from being embedded in Settings to a standalone page
    - Created /pages/Registries.tsx with a professional, modern UI
    - Added proper loading states, error handling, and responsive design
  3. ✅ Updated Navigation:
    - Added "Registries" to the main sidebar navigation
    - Added the appropriate server icon for registries
    - Connected the routing in main.tsx to handle /registries path
  4. ✅ Cleaned up Settings Page:
    - Removed the embedded registries section from Settings
    - Cleaned up unused imports
    - Deleted the old Settings/Registries.tsx file
  5. ✅ Confirmed API Integration:
    - Verified /v1/registries endpoint is working (200 responses)
    - Verified /v1/registries/types endpoint is working (200 responses)
    - Verified /v1/auth/info endpoint is working (200 responses)
    - Confirmed proper authentication and RBAC integration

  The container registry management system is now fully functional with:

  - Secure credential storage using AES-GCM encryption
  - Role-based access control (admin can manage, deployer+ can select)
  - Professional UI with proper loading states and error handling
  - Support for multiple registry types (Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR, generic)
  - Connection testing functionality for admins
  - Audit logging for all registry operations
  - Clean separation from other settings

  The user can now access container registry management through the dedicated "Registries" page in the
  sidebar navigation, and the previous "Access Restricted" error has been completely resolved.
