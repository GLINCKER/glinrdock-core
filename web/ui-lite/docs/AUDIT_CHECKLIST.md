# GLINRDOCK Audit Checklist

## Route Operations Audit Events

### ✅ Implemented Audit Events

#### `route.create`
- **Event Type**: `route.create`
- **Triggered**: When a new route is successfully created
- **Data Logged**:
  - `action`: "route_created"
  - `service_id`: ID of the service the route belongs to
  - `domain`: Domain name of the route
  - `path`: Path prefix (defaults to "/")
  - `port`: Target port number
  - `tls`: TLS/HTTPS enabled status
  - `route_id`: Generated route ID
  - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `user_agent`: Browser user agent string
- **Implementation**: `src/api.ts` - `createRoute()` method
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ Included in route creation tests

#### `route.delete`
- **Event Type**: `route.delete`
- **Triggered**: When a route is deleted
- **Data Logged**:
  - `action`: "route_deleted"
  - `route_id`: ID of the deleted route
  - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `user_agent`: Browser user agent string
- **Implementation**: `src/api.ts` - `deleteRoute()` method
- **Note**: Logged before deletion to capture route ID
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ Included in route deletion tests

#### `nginx.reload`
- **Event Type**: `nginx.reload`
- **Triggered**: When nginx configuration is reloaded
- **Data Logged**:
  - `action`: "nginx_configuration_reload"
  - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `user_agent`: Browser user agent string
- **Implementation**: `src/api.ts` - `nginxReload()` method
- **RBAC**: Admin-only operation
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ Included in nginx reload tests

### 📋 Audit Infrastructure

#### Audit Logging Method
- **Method**: `logAuditEvent(eventType: string, data: Record<string, any>)`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /system/audit`
- **Error Handling**: Non-blocking - failures logged to console but don't interrupt user operations
- **Data Format**:
  ```typescript
  {
    event_type: string,
    data: Record<string, any>,
    timestamp: string, // ISO 8601
    user_agent: string
  }
  ```

#### Backend Requirements
- **Endpoint**: `/v1/system/audit` (POST)
- **Authentication**: Requires valid bearer token
- **Storage**: Should store audit events with user context
- **Retention**: Configurable retention policy for audit logs
- **Access**: Admin-only access to audit log viewing

### 🔐 Security & Compliance Considerations

#### Data Privacy
- ✅ No sensitive data (passwords, tokens) logged in audit events
- ✅ User agent logged for security analysis
- ✅ Timestamps in UTC for consistency
- ✅ Route details logged for operational visibility

#### Access Control
- ✅ Audit events respect user authentication
- ✅ RBAC enforced for nginx reload operations
- ✅ User context captured via authentication headers

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Non-blocking audit logging prevents operation disruption
- ✅ Failed audit attempts logged to console for debugging
- ✅ Graceful degradation if audit backend unavailable

### 📊 Monitoring & Alerting

#### Metrics to Track
- [ ] **TODO**: Audit event volume and patterns
- [ ] **TODO**: Failed audit logging attempts
- [ ] **TODO**: Route creation/deletion trends
- [ ] **TODO**: Nginx reload frequency and timing

#### Alerting Scenarios
- [ ] **TODO**: High volume of route deletions
- [ ] **TODO**: Frequent nginx reload operations
- [ ] **TODO**: Failed audit logging (potential security issue)
- [ ] **TODO**: Unusual user agent patterns

### 🧪 Testing Coverage

#### Unit Tests
- ✅ Route creation with audit logging
- ✅ Route deletion with audit logging
- ✅ Nginx reload with audit logging
- ✅ Audit logging error handling
- ✅ Non-blocking behavior on audit failures

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] **TODO**: End-to-end audit event verification
- [ ] **TODO**: Audit backend availability handling
- [ ] **TODO**: User context verification in audit logs

### 📝 Documentation

#### User Documentation
- ✅ FAQ section explaining why nginx reload is needed
- ✅ RBAC permissions explained in UI
- ✅ Success/error feedback in user interface

#### Technical Documentation
- ✅ API documentation updated with audit events
- ✅ UI component documentation includes audit mentions
- ✅ Code comments explain audit event purposes

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

#### Additional Events to Consider
- [ ] **route.modify**: When route properties are updated
- [ ] **route.enable/disable**: If route toggling is implemented
- [ ] **bulk.operations**: When multiple routes are created/deleted at once
- [ ] **ssl.certificate**: When TLS certificates are provisioned/renewed

#### Enhanced Audit Data
- [ ] **user.context**: Capture user ID, role, project access
- [ ] **session.tracking**: Include session identifiers
- [ ] **ip.address**: Log client IP for security analysis
- [ ] **api.performance**: Track operation duration and success rates

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria Met

1. ✅ **Audit events implemented**: `route.create`, `route.delete`, `nginx.reload`
2. ✅ **Non-blocking logging**: Audit failures don't interrupt user operations
3. ✅ **Comprehensive data**: All relevant context captured in audit events
4. ✅ **Security conscious**: No sensitive data leaked in audit logs
5. ✅ **Test coverage**: All audit events covered by automated tests
6. ✅ **Documentation**: Complete audit checklist and implementation notes

### 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying audit functionality:

- [ ] **Backend audit endpoint**: Ensure `/v1/system/audit` endpoint is implemented
- [ ] **Database schema**: Audit events table/collection created
- [ ] **Retention policy**: Configure audit log retention (recommend 90 days minimum)
- [ ] **Access controls**: Admin-only access to audit log viewing implemented
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for audit system health
- [ ] **Privacy review**: Confirm no PII/sensitive data in audit events
- [ ] **Performance testing**: Verify audit logging doesn't impact user operations
- [ ] **Backup strategy**: Include audit logs in backup/restore procedures
